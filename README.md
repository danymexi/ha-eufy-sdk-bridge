# ha-eufy-sdk-bridge

The host-facing daemon: one process that logs into eufy **once** and exposes the
[`eufy-sdk`](https://github.com/mega-yfue/eufy-sdk) to a frontend — Home Assistant, a web UI,
anything. Ships as a multi-arch Docker image with [go2rtc](https://github.com/AlexxIT/go2rtc)
bundled, so live camera video is available as RTSP / WebRTC / MSE / HLS with nothing else to install.

```
WS    :3000/ws             control, state, events     ← the frontend talks to this
HTTP  :3000/stream/<sn>    live video (Annex-B)       ← go2rtc pulls this
HTTP  :3000/snapshot/<sn>  a JPEG still
HTTP  :3000/healthz        which cameras are streaming
```

Video is deliberately **not** on the WebSocket: the WS hands back a URL, and *connecting to that URL
is what starts the camera — disconnecting is what stops it*. There is no "stream is running" flag to
drift out of sync.

## Run it

Pull the published image and run it (bundles the SDK + go2rtc):

```bash
docker run -d --name eufy-bridge --network host \
  -e EUFY_EMAIL='you@example.com' -e EUFY_PASSWORD='…' -e EUFY_COUNTRY='GB' \
  -v /opt/eufy-bridge-data:/app/data \
  ghcr.io/mega-yfue/ha-eufy-sdk-bridge:latest
```

or with Compose (`cp .env.example .env` first): `docker compose up -d`.

| --- | --- |
| [`eufy-sdk`](https://github.com/mega-yfue/eufy-sdk) | the HA-agnostic library |
| **`ha-eufy-sdk-bridge`** | **this** — WS + HTTP + go2rtc daemon (Docker) |

> Status: working — WS control + auth-over-WS (2FA/captcha), device listing, snapshots, and go2rtc
> streaming. **Optional Anker Solix** support (power stations / smart meter, a separate account) via
> `SOLIX_EMAIL` / `SOLIX_PASSWORD` — see [docs/ws-protocol.md](./docs/ws-protocol.md) (`solix.*`). Published image: `ghcr.io/mega-yfue/ha-eufy-sdk-bridge` (multi-arch: `amd64` · `arm64` ·
> `arm/v7`). **Publishing a GitHub Release** builds and pushes the versioned + `:latest` tags
> automatically ([`.github/workflows/publish-ghcr.yml`](./.github/workflows/publish-ghcr.yml)); the same
> build runs locally via [`scripts/publish-multiarch.sh`](./scripts/publish-multiarch.sh).
