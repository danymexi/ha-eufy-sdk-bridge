 * Build the SDK client from config. `logger` is attached only under BRIDGE_DEBUG_P2P (raw transport logs).
 *
 * The logger is constructed WITHOUT a level so `ConsoleLogger`'s own `"debug"` default applies. The
 * transport lines this flag exists for are emitted at `debug`, and `LEVEL_RANK` puts `debug` below
 * `info`, so passing `"info"` here silenced exactly what the flag is meant to turn on: with it set you
 * got `p2pConnect` and nothing else, never the `[p2p] <sn> <<< …` frames.
