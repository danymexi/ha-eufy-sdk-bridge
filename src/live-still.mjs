// waking the camera for it. With SNAPSHOT_LIVE=auto a battery camera answers /snapshot from disk, and until
// now that meant the last event's thumbnail, which can be days old while someone watched the camera an hour
// ago. /stream already carries every frame through the bridge, so a watched stream's keyframes are turned
// into last-live-<sn>.jpg as it runs and once more when it ends; /snapshot serves whichever picture is newer.
//
// Each chunk of an openReadable() feed is one whole access unit, and keyframes carry their own parameter
// sets (SDK live-media docs), so a single keyframe decodes on its own — no SDK call, no extra P2P traffic.
