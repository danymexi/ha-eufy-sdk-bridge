# Build and push the bridge image as a MULTI-ARCH manifest to GitHub Container Registry.
#
# Why this exists: the add-on (ha-eufy-sdk-addon) builds FROM this image on aarch64 / armv7 / amd64
# (Home Assistant OS runs on Raspberry Pi as often as on x86), so a single-arch `docker build … && push`
# leaves ARM installs unable to resolve the base. `docker buildx --platform …` produces one manifest
# that carries all three; the Dockerfile already selects the go2rtc binary by TARGETARCH, so no
# per-arch edits are needed here.
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - Docker with buildx (Docker 20.10+).
#   - Logged in to ghcr.io:  echo "$GHCR_PAT" | docker login ghcr.io -u <user> --password-stdin
#     (the PAT needs `write:packages`.)
#   - The SDK sibling checkout at ../eufy-sdk (supplied as the `sdk` named build context — the bridge
#     depends on it as file:../eufy-sdk, which does not resolve inside the build otherwise).
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/publish-multiarch.sh              # version from package.json, tags :<version> + :latest
#   scripts/publish-multiarch.sh 0.1.36       # explicit version
#   PLATFORMS=linux/amd64,linux/arm64 scripts/publish-multiarch.sh   # override the platform set

# The SDK is a public npm package (@mega-yfue/eufy-sdk, pinned in package.json), pulled by `npm ci`
# inside the build — no sibling checkout or named build context needed.

# A dedicated builder so the host's default (often the docker driver, which can't do multi-platform)
# is left untouched. Reuse it across runs.
